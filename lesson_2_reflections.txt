What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?

	When you initialize a repository every file inside is listed as untracked. 
	The reason we need to do that is because the repository is where people can
	grab your code to collabote with.

How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What 
value do you think it offers?

	The staging area is where you can put a collection of things then put into the repository.
	It would allow a commit to pertain to a collective idea better.

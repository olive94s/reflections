When would you want to use a remote repository rahter than keeping all your work local?

  When you would want to collaborate with other people or when you are going to be working on it
  though other computers.

Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with
your remote repository?

	It would be better for it to be manual becuase then your code would be constantly changing since people could be
	working on it at any moment.
